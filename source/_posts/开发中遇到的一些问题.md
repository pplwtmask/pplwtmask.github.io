org.gradle.internal.execution.WorkValidationException: Some problems were found with the configuration of task ':compileJava' (type 'JavaCompile').
  - Type 'org.gradle.api.tasks.compile.JavaCompile' property 'options.compilerArgumentProviders.apt$0.name' is missing an input or output annotation.
    
    Reason: A property without annotation isn't considered during up-to-date checking.
    
    Possible solutions:
      1. Add an input or output annotation.
      2. Mark it as @Internal.
